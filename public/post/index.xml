      <description>I am currently learning about clustering methods. To work on these skills I am beginning a project that utilizes clustering to group NBA players together based on their play styles and attempt to see which play styles grouped together have the most success.</description>

      <description>This project tasked my team and I with using the python programming skills we learned to answer questions about a dataset. These questions required us to have knowledge of the packages matplotlib and csv for plotting and reading in the dataset as a .csv file. We also utilized a good understanding of data structures, conditional statements, and loops to complete this project.
 Worked together with a team where we used python to manipulate a large movie dataset in order to draw various inferences from the data Organized the dataset to make it possible for graphics to be made allowing for a clear interpretation of the data Applied knowledge of the python modules matplotlib and csv as well as loops, conditional statements, and data structures    Number of movies released in different months of 2016 by category   Link to GitHub Repository</description>

      <description>In this project I worked with a team to project an NBA Draft prospects NBA career success based only on pre-NBA data for each player (height, weight, age, college statistics, position, etc.). Then based on our projections we assigned a value to each pick number based on the expected win shares each pick should produce. This capstone project involved all stages of a data science project from framing the problem and pre-planning to the presenting of our findings and required the use of the skills and techniques I have learned throughout my degree.</description>
